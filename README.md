# Generate GitHub Commits

A command-line tool to generate your GitHub activity graph.

Does your profile look like you have stopped coding at all? 
No worries, this script will help you.

## How To Use

1. Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and 
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine.
3. Generate your commits:
   ```shell script
   npx fake-git-history
   ```
   It will create `my-history` folder, initialize git and generate commits for every day within the last year (0-3 commits per day).
4. Create [a private repository](https://github.com/new) in your GitHub called `my-history`
   and push the changes:
   ```shell script 
   cd my-history
   git remote add origin git@github.com:<USERNAME>/my-history.git 
   git push -u origin master
   ```

Done! Go take a look at your GitHub profile ðŸ˜‰

## Customizations

### `--commitsPerDay`

Specify how many commits should be created for every single day.
Default is `0,3` which means it will randomly make from 0 to 3 commits a day. Example:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --commitsPerDay "0,5"
```

### `--workdaysOnly`

Use it if you don't want to commit on weekends. Example:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --workdaysOnly
```

### `--startDate` and `--endDate`

By default, the script generates GitHub commits for every day within the last year.
If you want to generate activity for a specific dates, then use these options:

```shell script
npx fake-git-history --startDate "2020/09/01" --endDate "2020/09/30"
```

## PS 

It is something I wrote as a joke, so don't take it seriously. I don't encourage you to cheat, 
but if anybody is judging your professional skills by the graph at your GitHub profile, they deserve to see a rich activity graph ðŸ¤“
